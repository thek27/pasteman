# Pasteman

Pasteman is an electron based utility to help you re-use every day scripts. Select your desired command and it will be pasted on a (command) configurable application. You can

  - Just paste a command as is by selecting it
  - Replace a single value in the selected command with what you had already in the clipboard
  - Directly enter the values to be replaced using inline text & select boxes for multiple values

In order for this to work pasteman uses scripting languages that pertain to the underlying system

### Tech

* [AppleScript] - AppleScript is a scripting language created by Apple.
* [Ncp] - Asynchronous recursive file & directory copying
